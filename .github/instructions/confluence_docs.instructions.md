# Confluence Docs & Migration

## Applies when
- Editing `docs/**/*.md` or discussing Confluence content export/migration.

## Instructions
- Keep docs actionable and scoped to GitLab MCP usage; include the minimum env vars and authentication steps.
- For migrations, confirm source space, target path, and attachment handling; warn about size limits and partial exports.
- Prefer Markdown outputs and avoid embedding credentials or tokens in examples.
- Provide table-driven summaries when outlining multiple steps (space export, page mapping, attachment sync).
